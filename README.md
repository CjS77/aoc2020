# Advent of Code 2020

We'll be trying to solve this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles using
as _idiomatic_ Rust as possible!

Think lots of Functional Programming, Iterators, Pattern matching, type safety and other goodness.

The solutions are covered in a [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeSGG7k3MJmAJto72S2nn63j6eU8mVeiF)
so you can follow along.

As I post the videos, I'll merge the solutions into the main branch. This will be about a week after the puzzles
drop to avoid spoilers, but if you want to peek ahead, you can see more recent solutions in the `day_nn` branches
on this repo.

### Not idiomatic enough?

Post comments in the Youtube videos, or submit a PR!

_Happy Coding!_
